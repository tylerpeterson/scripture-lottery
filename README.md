Many spiritually inclined folks make it a habit to read scripture every day. Latter-day Saints (Mormons) are encouraged to read daily from the scriptures -- The Book of Mormon in particular.  With so many pages and topics, sometimes it's hard to even pick a spot to begin. This app helps break that mental gridlock by picking what you'll read for you. It's really an electronic equivalent of letting the book fall open and reading what you see first.
